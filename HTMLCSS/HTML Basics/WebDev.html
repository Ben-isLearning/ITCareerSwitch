      <h2>Development Process</h2>
      <p>
        Series of phases to complete the project timeframe <br />
        <strong>SDLC (Software Devlopment Life Cycle) <br /></strong>
        Concept <br />
        Analysis <br />
        Design <br />
        Testing <br />
        Implementation <br /><br />
        <br />

        Conceptualization <br />
        Taking a concept and evaluating if the concept will succeed. <br />
        + Define purpose to create foundations for development <br /><br />
        <br />

        Analysis <br />
        Determine reach / functionality / information topic <br />
        Determine information topic - What is the purpose of the website? Why
        are we doing it? why are we doing it this way? <br />
        Determine functionality requirements - What kind of experience will our
        users expect? complicated? simple? <br />
        Determine environmental requirements - what hardware is needed + how
        much bandwidth do we have? <br />
        Determine content requirements - what do we want to convey? what topics
        are currently in the "bubble"? <br />
        Review the competition's websites - what is good / bad <br />
        Estimate costs - what is it going to take to acheive this project?
        <br />
        Can we ship the project in stages? Alpha beta etc? <br />
        <br /><br />

        Design <br />
        Prepare and plan concepts, purpose and functionality of site. <br />
        Chose site organisation - Pick a structrue - Herarchical vs Linear
        <br />
        Design a prototype - give owners a prief look at what the site will do
        <br />
        Design a page layout - sketches / wireframes to determine the layout
        <br />
        Document each page - what does the page do spefically? (ie about page)
        keep track of changes. <br />
        <br /><br />

        Production <br />
        Bringing small peices together <br />
        what platform are we devloping? <br />
        authoring tool? WordPress / Google / Hand-code? <br />
        Organize the site, how do we store elements? what is the directory
        structure? naming schemes? <br />
        <br /><br />

        Develop and Test <br />
        Break the functionality down into small peices and test. <br />
        Test on different browsers - chrome / opera / firefox / safari <br />
        test on different devices - desktop / mobile / layout <br />
        test different screen resolutions - <br />
        test bandwidth - G2 G3 etc? <br />
        test outside host location - <br />
        test test test till it breaks <br />
        create physical document for testing requirements. <br />
        Automate testing - scripts / bots - Bot reporting <br />
        Accesibility Testing - meeting standards, zoom? color blind? voice
        narative? operable, understandable + robust <br />
        Test using more than one methods.- "Try to break this?" <br />
        Usability testing - Intuitive design / ease of learning / efficiency of
        use / memorability / error frequency + severity / subjective
        satisfaction <br />
        Launch - Get it out there! <br />
        Maintenance - Updates Software / Hardare <br />
        Evaluation - Does the final design/implementation meet all the
        requirements? <br /><br />

        Domain Name Overview - Describe your buisness (16+ characters?
        Abbreviate it!) <br />
        Keep domain name short, avoid hyphens, explore .com .net .org .co.uk .gg
        .io .me .site ...etc
        <br />
        Verify avaliabilty <br />
        Register domain before someone else does. Keep registration services
        private. <br />
        Physical host? Virtual host?

      <h2>Methodologies</h2>
      <p>
        <strong>Prototyping</strong> <br />
        Working model that gives stakeeholders an example opf the functionality
        <br />
        (Iterative process - Like Demos of new features) <br /><br />
        <strong>Spiral System Devlopment</strong> <br />
        Project is broken down into smaller peices <br />
        (Like sprint meetings with pointing etc) <br /><br />
        <strong>Joint Application Development JAD</strong> <br />
        Focuses on collaborative efforts of the team/teams of the project
        <br /><br />
        <strong>Agile Software Development</strong> <br />
        Methodology that acts on responsiveness between the client and the
        project team <br /><br />
        <strong>Organization-Specific Development Methodologies</strong> <br />
        in-house development tactics <br /><br />
