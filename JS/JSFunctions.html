    <h1>Functions</h1>
    <div>
      <h2>Functions</h2>
      <p>
        a Function is the term for a bundle (large or small) of code that is
        reusable <br />
        Functions Execute tasks or perform calculations <br />
        Functions are simply blocks of code that designed to perform particular
        tasks. <br /><br />
        Part 1; Functions need to be declared, created and given a purpose
        <br />
        Part 2; Functions need to be 'called' (or Invoked) by something in a
        different space <br />
        <br />
        Part 1 is the Setup, Part 2 is the Execution. <br />
      </p>
      <br />
    </div>

    <div>
      <h2>Anonymous Functions</h2>
      <p>
        Are functions that use the function keyword, don't have a name, don't
        take any values, <br />
        They just have keyword and parenthesis <br />
        Example: Declare a function, Set its Purpose... Then call it. <br />
        <br />
        Step 1: Create <br />
        <strong>
          let show = function () { <br />
          console.log("Anonymous Function"); }; <br />
        </strong>
        Step 2; Call <br />
        <strong>show();</strong>
        <br>
        <br>
        Example:  This is Janky AF <br>
        <strong>
          let x = function (a,b) {return a*b}; <br>
          console.log(x); <br>
          let z = x(4,3); <br>
          console.log(z); <br>
        </strong>
      </p>
      <br />
    </div>

    <div>
      <h2>Named Functions</h2>
      <p>
        Are functions that use the function keyword, a meaningful, descriptive
        name, have paramenters (Thus take arguements) and have parenthesis.
        <br />
        These functions are meant to be reusable snippets of goodness. <br />
        <br />
        Scenario: You're a trying to sell cheap rubbish as real Addidas goods.
        <br />
        Example; (Paste the <strong>Bolded</strong> text into the Console, Block
        by block) <br />
        <br />
        (Function Declaration) (Function Name(FunctionParameter)) {<br />
        (Parameter).(Attribute) (Set to) "Addidas"; <br />

        <br />
        <strong>
          function myAddidasRebrander(object) {<br />
          object.brand = "addidas";<br />
          }<br /><br />
        </strong>

        Declare the Object you wanna work on ~ Knockoff Chinese goods
        <br /><br />
        <strong>
          let trackSuit = {<br />
          brand: "chineseRubbish",<br />
          year: 2020<br />
          };<br /><br />
        </strong>
        Now... (Call / Invoke) Run 'myAddidasRebrander' function on the
        trackSuit object... <br />
        (Arguement = Different value to what function was declared with) <br />

        (Function Name (FunctionArguement)) <br />
        <br />
        <br />
        <strong>myAddidasRebrander(trackSuit); <br /></strong> <br />
        Then lets double check what's happened <br />
        <br />
        <strong>console.log(trackSuit); <br /></strong>
        <br />
        Hey Presto - Just like that we've got a top notch Addidas branded
        trackSuit!
      </p>
      <br />
      Example: 
    </div>

    <div>
      <h2>Invoking Functions</h2>
      <p>
        Functions can be Invoked (or Called) by an event <br />
        User clicking a button <br />
        Invoked by other JS Code <br />
        Automatically / Self-invoked <br />
        <br />

        The return Keyword defines the value that is "returned" <br />
        back to the caller, and causing the function to stop <br />
        <br />
        Example: Here, the function will return the product of a * b
        <br />
        <strong>
          function sumMultiplication (a, b) { <br />
          return a * b; <br />
          } <br />
        </strong>
        <br />
        <br />
        Example; Whereas here the same function is called, <br />
        but the returned value will be stored as the variable X<br />
        <strong>let x = sumMultiplication(4, 3); <br /></strong>
        <br />
        The code has been Executed once, Now we are able to use the output data
        (Variable X) <br />
        Elsewhere in our code / website <br> <br>
        We can take it a step further by including our function in an expression. <br> <br>
        <strong>let z = sumMultiplication(4,3) * 2; </strong>

      </p>
      <br />
    </div>

    <div>
      <h2>Best Practice; Declare before Invoking / Calling</h2>
      <p>
        Define your Functions in the Js file, then invoke them later. <br />
        If you attempt to invoke something before it is declared, It will go
        boom.
      </p>
      <p>
        <h4>Functions can be declared Globally, or Nested inside other functions.</h4>
        Example 1: Calculating the Square of something <br /> <br>
        <strong>
          function square(x) { <br />
          return x * x; <br />
          } <br />
        </strong>
        Invoke it to see it working; <br> 
        <strong>square(6); <br></strong>
        <br>
      </p>
      <br />
    </div>
    <div>
      <h2>Functions with Conditional Logic</h2>
      <p> Conditional logic inside of functions is a fantastic way to check input <br>
         To ensure that the functions aren't fragile. <br>
        Example; <br> <br>
        <strong>
          function multiply (x,y) { <br>
            return x*y; <br>
          } <br>
        </strong>
        <br>
        Checking... <br>
        <strong>
          multiply (4,3); <br>
          multiply (4); <br>
          multiply ("alpha", "beta"); <br>
        </strong>
        <br>
        This works great if you give it numbers. <br>
        But if you give in only one number, or anything but a number - it breaks! <br> 
        Lets bring in the conditional logic... <br>  <br>
        This function checks if the type of X or the type of Y is Not equal to number <br> 
        Before doing any further calculations <br> <br>


        <strong>
          function smartMultiply (x,y) {<br>
            if (typeof x != 'number' || typeof y != 'number') {<br>
              return "Invalid Input";<br>
            } else return x * y;<br>
          }<br>
        </strong>
        <br>
        Checking... <br>
        <strong>
          smartMultiply (4,3); <br>
          smartMultiply (4); <br>
          smartMultiply ("a",3); <br>
          smartMultiply (4,"2"); <br> <br>
        </strong>
        </p>
      <br />
    </div>
    <div>
      <h2>Functions with Multiple Arguements</h2>
      <p> Create a function to return the maximum value inside a collection of values. <br>
        This function declares max = 0, to be worked with later in the function <br>
        This function has a For Loop, for the length of the arguments its given <br>
        The conditional logic determines if the index of arguements is > max <br>
        Then max should equal the value at that index, otherwise no action <br>
        When loop has finished, return max (Which has been set to the highest value)  <br> <br>
      <strong>
        function findMax() { <br>
          let max = 0 <br>
          for (i = 0; i &lt; arguments.length; i++) { <br>
            if (arguments[i] > max) { <br>
              max = arguments[i]; <br>
            } <br>
          } <br>
          return max;  <br>
        }
      </strong><br>
      <br>
      Then Call it with various numbers <br> <br>
      <strong>x = findMax(1, 2, 30, 5, 700, 101, 22);</strong>
     </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        Create a function to return the total sum of all the given arguements. <br>
        This fuction declares sum = 0 to be worked with later ion the function <br>
        This function has a for loop, for the length of the arguements its given <br>
        The addition/assignment operator keeps adding the value of the index of arguements <br>
        When the loop has finished, Everything has been added, then sum is returned   <br><br>

        <strong>
          function sumAll() {<br>
            let sum = 0; <br>
            for ( i = 0; i &lt; arguments.length; i++) {<br>
              sum += arguments[i]; <br>
            }<br>
            return sum;<br>
          }<br> <br>
        </strong>

        Invoke / Call the function to see if it works... <br>
        <strong>sumAll(1, 4, 5, 1, 3, 5, 6, 10, 20); <br> <br></strong>

        Declare a variable, so that the total can be worked with later down the line... <br>
        <strong>let total =   sumAll(1, 4, 5, 1, 3, 5, 6, 10, 20); <br> <br></strong>

      </p>
