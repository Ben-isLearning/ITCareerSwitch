    <h1>Core Concepts + Syntax</h1>

    <div>
      <h2>Syntax</h2>
      <p>
        A set of rules defining the way in which JavaScript programs are
        constructed <br />
        <br />
        TL;DR ~ The Grammar of the language JavaScript. <br />
      </p>
      <p>
        Beware; JavaScript is Case Sensitive! <br />
        Alert("Won't Work") <br />
        alert("This Works) <br />
        Everything is Case Sensitive! <br />
        <strong>Variables, Functions, Methods, Objects, Everything!</strong>
      </p>
      <br />
    </div>

      <h2>Naming Conventions / Best Practices</h2>
      <p>
        To create reliable, consistent code that doesn't make your eyes burn
        <br />
        Best Practice = Informative, Descriptive name <br />
        submitButton rather than let1 <br />
        infoTextBox rather than myVariable <br />
        <br />
        let speedLimit = 70; <br />
        Rather than <br />
        let number1 = 70; <br />
        <br />
        Perhaps match Class or ID of HTML Elements with Variable names of JS
        <br />

        Majority of JS uses camel notation; <br />
        camelsHaveOneSmallHumpThenManyLargeHumps <br />
        <br />
        Some instances use the Pascal notation, <br />
        only in specific circumstances (Covered Later); <br />
        PascalLikesGoingHardFromTheBeginning. <br /><br />
        Spacing: Always use spaces around operators and after commas <br />
        let one = 1; <br />
        Rather than let one=1; <br />
      </p>
      <br />
    </div>

    <div>
      <h2>Literal Values</h2>
      <p>
        Number Literals: 4 | 4.5 <br />
        (It's literaly a Number)
      </p>
      <p>
        String Literals: "one" | "5" | 'abc101' <br />
        (Its literally a String of Characters "" or '' is fine)
      </p>
      <p>
        Array Literals: ["1", "2", "3",] <br />
        (Its Literally a BOX full of values)
      </p>
      <p>
        Boolean Literals: true | false <br />
        (Its Literally true or false (1 or 0))
      </p>
      <p>
        Object Literals: {Property(Key):Value} <br />
        (Literally CURLYBRACES filled with Key:Value pairs
      </p>
      <p>
        Variables: let x = 6; <br />
        (Literally a declaration that x is equal to 6)
      </p>
      <br />
    </div>

    <div>
      <h2>Operators</h2>
      <h4>Assignment Operator</h4>
      <p>
        = <br />
        Used to Assign value. <br />
        ( let x = 12; )
      </p>
      <h4>Arithemetic Operators</h4>
      <p>
        + | - | * | / <br />
        Used to Compute values. <br />
        <br />
        (let x = a + b;) <br />
        (let y = a - b;) <br />
        (let alpha = x*y;) <br />
        (let Beta = x/y;) <br />
      </p>
      <h4>Comparison Operators</h4>
      <p>
        Used to compare values. <br />
        == | === | != | &lt; | > | <br />
        if ( 1 == '1') ~ Loose Equality - Looks at Value (True) <br />
        if ( 1 === '1') ~ Strict Equality - Looks at Value + Type (False) <br />
        if ( x != 5 ) ~ NOT equal - Determines if 1st Value is NOT equal to 2nd
        Value (True) <br />
        if ( x &lt; 6) ~ LESSTHAN - Determines If 1st value is SMALLER than 2nd
        value <br />
        if ( x > 6) ~ GREATERTHAN - Determines if 1st value is BIGGER than 2nd
        value <br />
      </p>
      <br />
    </div>
    <div>
      <h2>Expressions</h2>
      <p>
        An expression is a combination of Values Variables and Operators <br />
        which computes to an <strong>evaluation</strong> (A Result) <br />
      </p>
      <p>
        Expressions: <br />
        15 * 10; <br />
        myValue+10; <br />
        "John" + "" + "Doe"; <br />
      </p>
      <br />
    </div>

    <div>
      <h2>Keywords</h2>
      <p>
        ** Keywords cannot be used as variable names** <br />
        ** Give Variables Meaningfull names ** <br /><br />
        let - Declares a Variable <br />
        for - Marks a block of code to be executed for as long as a condition is
        true <br />
        if ... else - Marks a block of code to be executed based on a condition
        <br />
        return - Exits a function <br />
        break - Terminates a switch or loop <br />
        function - declares a function <br />
      </p>
      <br />
    </div>

    <div>
      <h2>Comments</h2>
      <p>
        Create comments in JS by typing // before <br />
        If its a multiline Comment, Begin with /* and end with */ <br />
        Add Descriptive comment before code, not after. <br />
        States Purpose of code - Public Comments
        <br />
      </p>
