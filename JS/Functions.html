    <h1>Functions</h1>

      <h2>Functions</h2>
      <p>
        a Function is the term for a bundle (large or small) of code that is
        reusable <br />
        Functions Execute tasks or perform calculations <br />
        Functions are simply blocks of code that designed to perform particular
        tasks. <br /><br />
        Part 1; Functions need to be declared, created and given a purpose
        <br />
        Part 2; Functions need to be 'called' (or Invoked) by something in a
        different space <br />
        <br />
        Part 1 is the Setup, Part 2 is the Execution. <br />

      <h2>Anonymous Functions</h2>
      <p>
        Are functions that use the function keyword, don't have a name, don't
        take any values, <br />
        They just have keyword and parenthesis <br />
        Example: Declare a function, Set its Purpose... Then call it. <br />
        <br />
        Step 1: Create <br />
        <strong>
          let show = function () { <br />
          console.log("Anonymous Function"); }; <br />
        </strong>
        Step 2; Call <br />
        <strong>show();</strong>
      </p>
      <br />
    </div>

    <div>
      <h2>Named Functions</h2>
      <p>
        Are functions that use the function keyword, a meaningful, descriptive
        name, have paramenters (Thus take arguements) and have parenthesis.
        <br />
        These functions are meant to be reusable snippets of goodness. <br />
        <br />
        Scenario: You're a trying to sell cheap rubbish as real Addidas goods.
        <br />
        Example; (Paste the <strong>Bolded</strong> text into the Console, Block
        by block) <br />
        <br />
        (Function Declaration) (Function Name(FunctionParameter)) {<br />
        (Parameter).(Attribute) (Set to) "Addidas"; <br />

        <br />
        <strong>
          function myAddidasRebrander(object) {<br />
          object.brand = "addidas";<br />
          }<br /><br />
        </strong>

        Declare the Object you wanna work on ~ Knockoff Chinese goods
        <br /><br />
        <strong>
          let trackSuit = {<br />
          brand: "chineseRubbish",<br />
          year: 2020<br />
          };<br /><br />
        </strong>
        Now... (Call / Invoke) Run 'myAddidasRebrander' function on the
        trackSuit object... <br />
        (Arguement = Different value to what function was declared with) <br />

        (Function Name (FunctionArguement)) <br />
        <br />
        <br />
        <strong>myAddidasRebrander(trackSuit); <br /></strong> <br />
        Then lets double check what's happened <br />
        <br />
        <strong>console.log(trackSuit); <br /></strong>
        <br />
        Hey Presto - Just like that we've got a top notch Addidas branded
        trackSuit!
