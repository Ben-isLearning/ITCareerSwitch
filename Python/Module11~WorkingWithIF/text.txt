If statements 

decision making is when we want to execute a code only if a certain condition is satisfied. 


x = 12
y = 3
if x > y:
    print("X is greater than Y")
#Print function will be executed


x = 1
y = 3
if x > y:
    print("X is greater than Y")
#Nothing will happen   


Compound Conditional Statements: "else" and "elif" (Else IF) along with "if"

x = 1
y = 3
if x > y:
    print("X is greater than Y")
else:
    print("Y is greater than X")
#Else will be executed. 


x = 1
y = 3
if x > y:
    print("X is greater than Y")
elif x == y: 
    print("X and Y are equal")
else:
    print("Y is greater than X")
#Else will be executed. 


x = 3
y = 3
if x > y:
    print("X is greater than Y")
elif x == y: 
    print("X and Y are equal")
else:
    print("Y is greater than X")
#elif will be executed. 


#       Can use as many elif blocks as we like.  

#       Only appropreate when we need one codeblock (to test one pass) to be evaluated. / Will skip rest of codeblocks  (the tests)  

#       If we need to check the all of the conditions of interest, use a series of if statements.
