Defining Functions; 

> A function is a block of code which only runs when it is called. 
> Can pass data to a block of code, Known as a parameter. 


            >Functions are defined using def 

def function_one():
    print("Hello World!")

            >Functions need to be called

function_one()



            >Functions can be defined with parameters, seperated by Comas. 

def function_two(fname, lname):
    print(f"Hello there, {fname} {lname}. How do you do?")

function_two("Dave", "Larke")


            >Can create our own Modules using functions. 
            >Create File A with Functionality 
            >Create File B with <Other>, Import from File A. 


    > File A 

def greet():
    print("Hello there, how are you today?")


    > File B 

import hello

hello.greet()
