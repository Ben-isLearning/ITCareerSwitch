Working With Primitive Data types;

Primitive Data - Simplest forms of representing data 
(Non-Primitive Data is designed to organise and manage sets of primitive data) 

Rules to abide by; 
Names only contain Letters or _         
Not Allowed Spaces
Not Allowed keywords / function names 
Short but descriptive.                  

Syntax Error ~ Miss typed something 
Logic Error ~ incorrect computations 

Focusing on string - 

Primitive Data Types 
int     Integer         (-2 | 123 | 23123123)               (Whole Numbers)       (Number in JS)
float   Float           (12.12 | 0.1 | 1231.123)            (Fractional Number)   (Number in JS)
str     String          ("characters")      (String in JS)
Bool    Boolean         (True/False)        (Boolean in JS)

Declaring a string ~ 
Python: varString = "text" 
Python: varString2 = 'text' 

JS :    let varString = "text"
JS :    let varString2 = 'text' 


Declare: 
stringOne ="hello" 
stringTwo = stringOne       
# stringTwo has been declared as the current value of stringOne#

print(stringOne)
print(stringTwo)

stringOne ="i am different" 
print(stringOne)
print(stringTwo)

# stringTwo has not been re-declared  #


Methods? 
What is a method?
A Method is an action that python can perform on a piece of data.
method() 


title() 
The title() method returns a string where the first character 
in every word is upper case. Like a header, or a title.

firstString = "i want to ride a biscuit"
newString = firstString.title()

print(newString)
newString = I Want To Ride A biscuit


upper()
The upper() method returns a string where all characters are in upper case.

firstString = "i want to ride a biscuit"
upperString = firstString.upper()

print(upperString)
upperString = I WANT TO RIDE A BISCUIT


lower()
The lower() method returns a string where all characters are lower case.
upperString = "I WANT TO RIDE A BISCUIT"
lowerString = upperString.lower()

print(lowerString)
lowerString = i want to ride a biscuit


Concatenation (Adding strings to strings) 

firstString = "i want to ride a biscuit"
comedyString = "Yeah!" 
lyrics = firstString + ", " + firstString + ", " + firstString + ", " + comedyString 
print(lyrics)
name = "dave"
age = 40 
print(name + " Age " + age)
"TypeError: can only concatenate str (not "int") to str"


To overcome abnormal user input, python uses 3 methods to strip whitespace

strip()
lstrip()
rstrip() 

userInput = "        socks            " 
print(userInput.strip())
