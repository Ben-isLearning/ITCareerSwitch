a List is a data structure in Python that is a changeable ordered sequence of elements. 

"Variable on steroids" 

Each element within a List, is refered to as an item.
lists are defined by having values between square brackets. 
From here on out, list will be typed as []

[] are fantastic for multiple replated values. 

courses = ["HTML", "CSS", "JavaScript", "Python"]

Each item has an index, starting @ 0. 
courses[0] = "HTML"
courses[1] = "CSS"
courses[2] = "JavaScript"
courses[3] = "Python"

(Or from the back)

courses[-4] = "HTML"
courses[-3] = "CSS"
courses[-2] = "JavaScript"
courses[-1] = "Python"
