Writing Files 

Access mode is mission critical - can't do things if we're not in the right mode.

with open("demo2.txt") as alpha:        << Open File
    alphaContents = alpha.read()        << Read File
    print(alphaContents)                << Print File

beta = open("demo2.txt", "w")           << Open as "w" for WRITE
beta.write("Are you sure?")             << Write (Overwrite)
beta.close()                            << Close the file  >>CRITCAL<<

with open("demo2.txt") as alpha:        << Open File 
    alphaContents = alpha.read()        << Read File
    print(alphaContents)                << Print File 


To Create a New File, use open() 

With either; 

"x"     Create      ~ Will Create a File                    / Return error if file Exists 
"a"     Append      ~ Will Create File if does not exist.   / Add to end   if file Exists
"w"     Write       ~ Will Create file if does not exist.   / Overwrite    if file exists. 



yankee = open("BenText.txt", "x")   << Open File / Create Brand New File
