Reading Files

To read or write to a file, first we need to open it!

To open a file in Python, use open()
~Function returns a file object (i.e a handle)
~Can be used to read or modify the file 

To read a file in Python, use read()
~ This returns the entirety of the file.
~ This can be used with an arguement to return an amount of characters~ read(x)

To read a single line in Python, use readline()
~ This returns the single 

To close a connection after reading, use close()
~ This prevents leaving data "open for use" 

Alernatively, we can use "with" 
~ This opens and closes the file (Not needing close())
~ ++ Great for bugged programs (Programs that break before they reach close())

To write to an existing file, we need to add parameter to open() 
~ open("demo.txt", "a") | open("demo.txt", "w") 

To write to an existing file, use write() 
~ This adds on whatever is included to the file. 




file object = open("file_name"[, "access_mode"])

alpha = open("demo.txt", "r")
print(alpha.read())                 << Reads whole document

alpha = open("demo.txt", "r")
print(alpha.read(24))               << Reads first 24 characters of Document. 
alpha.close()

beta = open("demo.txt", "r")
print(beta.readline())              << Reads first Line of Document. 
beta.close()

with open("demo.txt") as charlie:   << Declare variable "charlie"    holding open("demo.txt")
contents = charlie.read()           << Declare variable "contents"   holding charlie.read()
print(contents)                     << Print                         "contents"

delta = open("demo.txt", "a")               << Open "xxx.txt"
delta.write("\n Its nearly lunch time!")    << Ammend data
delta.close()                               << (In demo read/apend/read )





Access mode is optional 
Default is r (read) 
rb  (Read + Binary)
r+  (Read + Write)
rb+ (Read + Write + Binary)

w   (Write)
wb  (Write in Binary)
w+  (Write + Read | Same as w)
wb+ (Write + Read + Binary | same as w)

a   (Append)
ab  (Append + Binary | same as a) 
a+  (Append + Read | same as a )
ab+ (Append + Binary + Read | same as a )


Common: 
r       Read-Only   ~ Access Only
r+      Read+Write  ~ Write Level   ~ Overwrite or Create new file
w       Write       ~ Write Level   ~ Overwrite or Create new file
a       Append      ~ Added         ~ Add to end of file Or Create new file.  
a+      Append+Read ~
