for loops 

(Loop through different iterations)
Using loops allows us to automate and repeat similar tasks multiple times. 

colors = ["red", "blue", "green"]

for variable in colors: 
    print(x)


** Recomended  Naming **
colors = ["red", "blue", "green"]

for color in colors: 
    print(color)



in loops, range() is used to control how many times the loop will be repeated 
range() takes 1, 2 or 3 arguements. 
range(start, stop, step).

range(0,3,1) > Start 0, Stop 3, count by 1.
