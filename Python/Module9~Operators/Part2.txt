Types of Operators: 

Arithmetic | Assignment | Comparison | Logical | Identity | Membership | Bitwise 


Comparison (Compare X with Y):

==      Equal to        a == b
!=      NOT equal to    a != b
>       Greater Than    3 > 2
<       Less Than       3 < 4 
>=      GT or equal to  a >= 3 
<=      LT or equal to  a <= 10


Logical ( Combine two comparison statements)

and     True if both statements are true        10 < 100 and 10 > 1 
or      True if a single statmenet is true      10 < 100 or 10 = 100
not     Reverses the state of the operand       not(10 < 100 and 10 > 1)
