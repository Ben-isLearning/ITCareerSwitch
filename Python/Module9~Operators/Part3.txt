Types of Operators: 

Arithmetic | Assignment | Comparison | Logical | Identity | Membership | Bitwise 

Identity (Disregard values - Look at variable): 

is          True if both are the same       a is b 
is not      True if both are NOT the same   a is not c 



Membership (Does x exist in y) / (Does x not (exist) in y): 

in          True if value is present in the object          a   in alphabet  
not in      True if value is not present in the object      123 in alphabet



Bitwise (Binary 1s and 0s): 

%           Bitwise AND         
|           Bitwisee OR
^           Bitwise XOR (Set to 1 if only single value is 1)

**bin()
Function to convert integer into binary. 

In Python, binary starts with "0b" - then the number
Binary consists of 8 digits
alpha = 101 =  01100101  (0b1100101)
beta  = 042 =  00101010  (0b101010)



& Checks for existence of 1 at the same places;

A)  01100101
B)  00101010

&)  00100000  (32 in regular)



| Checks for existence of 1 at either places; 
A)  01100101
B)  00101010

|)  01101111 (111 in regular)



^ Checks for the existence of a 1 in a single place per value; 
A)  01100101
B)  00101010

^)  01001111  (79 in regular)
