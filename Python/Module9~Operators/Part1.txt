Types of Operators: 

Arithmetic | Assignment | Comparison | Logical | Identity | Membership | Bitwise 

Arithmetic (Math):

+   Addition        a + b
-   Subtraction     a - b 
*   Multiplication  a * b 
/   Division        a / b
**  Exponential     a ** b  (a ^ b)
%   Modulus         a % b   (Remainder of a / b) 



Assignment (Assigning Value): 

=      Equals                       a = 1
+=     Add Value Equal to           a += 3 
-=     Sub Value equal to           a -= 3
*=     Multiply by Value            a *= 2
/=     Divide by value              a /= 3
**=    ^ by value                   a **= 3
