Modify Lists 

Adding + Taking away 

We can use indexing to change items within the list! 
By setting the index number to a different value; 

shopping = ['Bread', 'Milk', 'Eggs', 'Generic']
shopping[0] = 'Coffee' 
print(shopping)


Adding items onto the end of Lists with + operator 
shopping = ['Bread', 'Milk', 'Eggs', 'Generic']
shopping = shopping + ['Coffee']

print (shopping)



Adding items in a particular place  with .insert(i,x)  i = index, x = value 
shopping = ['Bread', 'Milk', 'Eggs', 'Generic']
shopping.insert(1, 'Coffee') 

print(shopping)



Removing items in a particular place with .del[i] i = index 
shopping = ['Bread', 'Milk', 'Eggs', 'Generic']
del shopping[2]

print(shopping)



Removing KNOWN values in a list with .remove(x)  x = value 
shopping = ['Bread', 'Milk', 'Eggs', 'Generic']
shopping.remove('Generic') 

print(shopping)



Printing Lists and Lists with + operator 
shopping = ['Bread', 'Milk', 'Eggs', 'Generic']
moreShopping = ['Cake', 'Booze', 'Obscure']

print(shopping + moreShopping)



Looping through a list  with a for in loop  ~ Printing each item as sting
shopping = ['Bread', 'Milk', 'Eggs', 'Generic']
for value in shopping: 

    print(value)


Determining if specific item exists within list
shopping = ['Bread', 'Milk', 'Eggs', 'Generic']
if 'Bread' in shopping:
    print("Yes, Bread is on the list")


Checking how long a list is / how many values exist within a list with len() 
shopping = ['Bread', 'Milk', 'Eggs', 'Generic']
print(len(shopping))
