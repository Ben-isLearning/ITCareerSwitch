while loops 

(Loop through different iterations) (while a specific condition is true)
Using loops allows us to automate and repeat similar tasks multiple times.

a = 1
while a < 6: 
print(a) 
a += 1


with the "continue" statement - we ca nstop the current iteration, and continue with the next. 

a = 1
while a < 6: 
a += 1
if a == 4: 
 continue
print(a) 


with the "break" statement - we can stop the loop even if the while condition is true.

a = 1
while a < 6: 
print(a) 
a += 1
if a == 4: 
break 
a += 1
